# Dynamic Routing with RIP Version 1 in a Multi-Subnet Network
Overview:
This project involves the configuration of a dynamic routing network using RIP Version 1 (Routing Information Protocol) across multiple subnets. The setup is simulated in Cisco Packet Tracer and includes three different subnetworks interconnected via routers. The goal is to ensure seamless communication between all devices within and across the subnetworks while optimizing the network design with minimal resources.

Network Topology:
The network consists of three primary routers connected to multiple PCs through switches, with each router representing a different subnet:

Router 0 (192.168.1.1): Connects three PCs within the 192.168.1.x subnet.
Router 1 (192.168.2.1): Manages connections for three PCs in the 192.168.2.x subnet.
Router 2 (192.168.3.1): Handles connections for three PCs in the 192.168.3.x subnet.
Each router is linked to a switch, which in turn connects to multiple PCs, creating isolated subnets within the larger network.

Configuration Details:
Static IP Assignment: Each PC within the subnets was assigned a static IP address corresponding to its routerâ€™s subnet.
Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Version 1: RIP v1 was implemented on each router to dynamically exchange routing information. This protocol helps in automatically updating routing tables, allowing for efficient data transfer between different subnets.
Inter-Router Connections: The routers are interconnected through serial links using a dedicated network (10.0.0.0/24). This setup facilitates communication between the different subnets by routing data through the appropriate paths.
Network Communication:
The configuration ensures that all devices within each subnet can communicate with each other and with devices in other subnets. The use of RIP v1 simplifies the routing process, automatically managing routes between subnets and adjusting as new routes or devices are added.

Project Highlights:
Dynamic Routing: RIP v1 enables dynamic updates of the routing table, reducing the need for manual configuration as the network grows or changes.
Efficient Subnet Management: By assigning distinct subnets and using RIP for dynamic routing, the network maintains organized and efficient communication across multiple devices and subnets.
Resource Optimization: The network design minimizes the use of routers and switches while maintaining robust communication capabilities, making it both cost-effective and scalable.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the effective use of RIP v1 for dynamic routing in a multi-subnet environment. The configuration not only allows for seamless communication across all devices within the network but also optimizes resource usage, making it ideal for scalable network setups. The successful simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer showcases the practical application of RIP v1 in managing complex network topologies.
